Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.114 nm, buffer size 0.114 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.041 nm, buffer size 0.041 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25

Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx_mpi was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx_mpi with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
