Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 28510.00
Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 355 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.114 nm, buffer size 0.114 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.041 nm, buffer size 0.041 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 52x52x52, spacing 0.096 0.096 0.096
This run will generate roughly 1 Mb of data
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25

Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

Running on 1 node with total 16 cores, 16 logical cores (GPU detection deactivated)
Hardware detected on host nid02345 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: AuthenticAMD
    Brand:  AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6274                 
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_128_FMA
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_128_FMA


The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx_mpi was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx_mpi with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
