    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_128_FMA

Compiled SIMD instructions: AVX_128_FMA, GROMACS could use AVX_256 on this machine, which is better

NOTE: 16 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      28 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
