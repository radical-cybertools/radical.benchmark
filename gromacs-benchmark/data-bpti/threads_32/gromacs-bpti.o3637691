    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_128_FMA


The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx_mpi was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx_mpi with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

NOTE: 16 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      30 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
