Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

Running on 1 node with total 16 cores, 16 logical cores (GPU detection deactivated)
Hardware detected on host nid03792 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: AuthenticAMD

    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_128_FMA


The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx_mpi was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx_mpi with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

NOTE: 11 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      37 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
